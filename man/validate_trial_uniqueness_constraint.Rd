\title{Check if within aoi_timepoints table, there is no duplication in all the administration_ids
  associated with each individual trial_id}
\usage{
validate_trial_uniqueness_constraint(df_aoi_timepoints)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_table}{the aoi_timepoints dataframe}

\item{cdi_expected}{specifies whether cdi_data is to be expected to be present in the imported data;
only relevant for subjects table.
We could consider creating a special table type, so that invalid combinations of table_type and cdi_expected cannot happen, but it does not break anything, so low priority}
}
\value{
an empty string when all the administration_ids are unique within each trial_id;
  Otherwise, the error message will be returned.
